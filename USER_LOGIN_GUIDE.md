## Troubleshooting

### Can't Login - Invalid Credentials
- **Check email spelling** - emails are case-insensitive but must match exactly
- **Verify password** - passwords are case-sensitive
- **Check Caps Lock** is off
- **Create new account** if you've forgotten credentials

### Session Expired
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Simply login again with your credentials
- Session cookie will be refreshed

### Redirected to Login Unexpectedly
- Token may have expired
- Cookie may have been cleared
- Login again to restore session

### Can't Access Admin Panel
- Customer accounts have `CUSTOMER` role by default
- Admin panel requires `ADMIN` role
- To upgrade an account to admin, use Neo4j:
  ```bash
  docker exec factory-bay-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p factorybay123 \
    "MATCH (u:User {email: 'your-email@example.com'}) SET u.role = 'ADMIN' RETURN u.email, u.role"
  ```
- Or create a script at `scripts/set-admin-role.ts` if needed

### Account Creation Fails
- **Email already exists** - use different email or login with existing account
- **Weak password** - ensure password meets requirements
- **Validation errors** - check all required fields are filled

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify Neo4j is running
docker ps

# Test database connection
npm run db:init

# Check environment variables
cat .env.local
```
