---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker Desktop (for Neo4j and MinIO)
- npm or yarn

### One-Command Setup (Recommended) ⚡

Use the automated setup script to manage everything:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <your-repo>
cd TheFactoryBay
npm install

# 2. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# 3. Start everything!
./setup.sh start
```

That's it! The script will:
- ✅ Start Neo4j & MinIO containers
- ✅ Detect empty database and offer to initialize
- ✅ Create test users automatically
- ✅ Optionally setup category hierarchy (Ladies/Gents/Kids)
- ✅ Start Next.js dev server
- ✅ Show all service URLs and credentials

**Open http://localhost:3000** 🎉

### Setup Script Commands

The `./setup.sh` script is your central control panel for managing the entire Factory Bay infrastructure:

```bash
# Service Management
./setup.sh start              # Start all services (auto-detects empty DB)
./setup.sh stop               # Stop all services (data preserved)
./setup.sh restart            # Restart all services
./setup.sh status             # Show detailed service status

# Monitoring & Logs
./setup.sh logs nextjs        # View Next.js development logs
./setup.sh logs neo4j         # View Neo4j database logs
./setup.sh logs minio         # View MinIO storage logs
./setup.sh health             # Run health check on all services

# Reset Commands
./setup.sh reset soft         # Restart services & clean cache (keeps data)
./setup.sh reset hard         # Delete ALL data & volumes (requires 'yes')

# Backup & Recovery
./setup.sh backup all         # Backup both Neo4j and MinIO
./setup.sh backup neo4j       # Backup database only
./setup.sh backup minio       # Backup image storage only

# Volume Management
./setup.sh volumes            # Show Docker volume info & disk usage

# Help
./setup.sh help               # Show all available commands
```

**Why use setup.sh?**
- ✅ Automatic empty database detection
- ✅ Interactive prompts for initialization
- ✅ Shows all credentials on startup
- ✅ Health checks before starting services
- ✅ Colored output for easy reading
- ✅ One command for everything

### Reset Commands Explained

**Soft Reset** (`./setup.sh reset soft`):
- Restarts all services (Neo4j, MinIO, Next.js)
- Cleans Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)
- **Preserves all data** (users, products, orders, images)
- Use when: Next.js has issues, need fresh start without data loss

**Hard Reset** (`./setup.sh reset hard`):
- Stops all services
- **Deletes ALL Docker volumes** (database + images)
- **PERMANENTLY REMOVES** all users, products, orders, images
- Requires typing "yes" to confirm
- Offers to reinitialize database after cleanup
- Use when: Starting completely fresh, testing from scratch
- **⚠️ WARNING:** This cannot be undone!

### Test Accounts (Auto-Created)

| Account | Email | Password |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Admin | `testadmin@factorybay.com` | `Admin123!` |
| Customer | `test@example.com` | `Customer123!` |

**Service URLs:**
- Factory Bay: http://localhost:3000
- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474 (`neo4j` / `factorybay123`)
- MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (`factorybay` / `factorybay123`)

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d

# 2. Initialize database schema
npm run db:init

# 3. Seed test users
npm run db:seed

# 4. Start Next.js
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Using `./setup.sh` is recommended as it handles everything automatically!
